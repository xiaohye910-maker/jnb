Display a simple banner/bar at the top or bottom of your website. Now with multi-banner support.

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to display a simple announcement banner or bar at the top of your website. You can easily customize the color of the links, text, and background of the bar from within the settings. You can also customize to your heart's desire by adding your own custom CSS. There's also a fancy preview section within the settings so you can see your changes before you save them.

= Now with multi-banner support =
With Pro features you can display up to 5 separate banners on your site. Banners can be shown simultaneously or plan weeks of banners by showing them consecutively. 

== Installation ==

= From your WordPress dashboard =

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Search for 'Simple Banner'
3. Activate 'Simple Banner' from your Plugins page.
4. Visit 'Simple Banner' in the sidebar to create a new banner.

= From WordPress.org =

1. Download 'Simple Banner'.
2. Upload the 'simple-banner' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc...)
3. Activate 'Simple Banner' from your Plugins page.
4. Visit 'Simple Banner' in the sidebar to create a new banner.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the banner look like in my DOM? =

This is how the banner will look in your HTML:

`<code>
    <div id="simple-banner" class="simple-banner">
      <div class="simple-banner-text">
        <span>
          YOUR SIMPLE BANNER TEXT HERE
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
</code>
`

= The banner or changes to the banner aren't showing up, or are only showing up when I'm logged in, what's wrong? =

Your browser frequently caches scripts associated with a website in order to improve speed and performance. There are also some
wordpress plugins that cache scripts to improve performance. If you aren't seeing your banner or the changes you made to the banner,
first clear your browser cache and if that doesn't work, look for any plugin that bundles or caches scripts and clear that as well.

= Why is my banner covering my header or behind my header? =

Your theme probably uses absolute positioning for its header in this case. Try changing the positioning of your banner or change "Prepend element" to <code><header></code> and see if that helps. If none of this works, you may need a custom solution for your banner. You can either try to find another plugin that suits your needs or you can purchase the pro version and open a support ticket to fix your situation.

= Is there a Pro version? =

Yes, but you should look through the support topics before you decide if you need the pro version.

= Does this plugin use cookies? =

Yes, they are used only if you enable the close button. These cookies fall under the category of "strictly necessary cookies" and do not need consent from the user, more information <a target="_blank" href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/">here</a>. 
If cookies are disabled on the user's browser, the banners close button expiration setting will not work and the banner will show on each refresh.

= How do I re-enable my banner after I hit the close button =

You can clear your browser's cookies or in the browser's console you can execute:

`document.cookie = "simplebannerclosed=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/";
`

You can also set your Close button expiration to blank, 0, or a date in the past. This method may require a refresh or two of the browser on your website page.

= I have the Divi theme and the banner isn't showing. =

Try setting the "Prepend element" setting to <code>header</code>. If that doesn't work, set your banner position to <code>relative</code> and try this in 'Website Custom CSS':

`#main-header:not(.et-fixed-header) {
  position: relative;
}`
`#top-header:not(.et-fixed-header) {
  position: relative;
}`
