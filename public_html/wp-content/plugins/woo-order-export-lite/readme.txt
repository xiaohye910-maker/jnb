= I want to add a product attribute to the export  =
Check screenshot #5! You should open section "Set up fields", open section "Product order items"(right column), click button "Add field", select field in 1st dropdown, type column title and press button "Confirm".

= Same order was exported many times =
You should open section "Set up fields to export" and set "Fill order columns for" to  "1st row only". The plugin repeats common information for each order item (by default).

= I see only GREEN fields in section "Set up fields"  =
Please, unmark checkbox "Summary Report By Products" (it's below date range)

= Red text flashes at bottom during page loading = 
It's a normal situation. The plugin hides this warning on successful load. 

= I can't filter/export custom attribute for Simple Product =
I'm sorry, but it's impossible. You should add this attribute to Products>Attributes at first and use "Filter by Product Taxonomies".

= How can I add a Gravity Forms field to export? =
Open order, look at items and remember meta name.
Visit WooCommerce>Export Orders,
open section "Set up fields", open section "Product order items"(at right), click button "Add field",
select SAME name in second dropdown (screenshot #5)

= Plugin produces unreadable XLS file =
The theme or another plugin outputs some lines. Usually, there are extra empty lines at the end of functions.php(in active theme).

= I can't export Excel file (blank message or error 500) =
Please, increase "memory_limit" upto 256M or ask hosting support to do it.

= When exporting .csv containing european special characters , I want to open this csv in Excel without extra actions =
You  should open tab "CSV" and set up ISO-8859-1 as codepage.

= Preview shows wrong values,  I use Summary mode =
This button processes only first 5 orders by default, so you should run the export to see correct values.

= Where does free version save files? = 
Free version doesn't save generated file on your webserver, you can only download it using browser.

= Can I request any new feature ? =
Yes, you can email a request to aprokaev@gmail.com. We intensively develop this plugin.
