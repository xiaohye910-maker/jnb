== Formerly WooCommerce Checkout Manager ==

This plugin was formerly known as "WooCommerce Checkout Manager." On November 8, 2019, WordPress required us to change the plugin name due to the use of "WooCommerce" in the title. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the downtime.

== Features ==

Checkout Field Manager (Checkout Manager) for WooCommerce allows you to include custom fields in the checkout page, related to the Billing, Shipping, or Additional sections.

- Reorder fields
- Rename and highlight fields
- Show, hide, or extend checkout fields within the Billing, Shipping, and Additional sections

== Conditional Checkout Fields ==

Checkout Field Manager supports conditional checkout fields, allowing you to show or hide fields based on the value of parent fields.

The system detects the parent field type and lets you define conditional logic based on the available options.

== File Upload in Checkout ==

You can include an unlimited number of file upload fields. Users will be able to upload or delete files through the order page. Uploaded files are visible in the order details.

== Checkout Process Customization ==

Checkout Field Manager lets you customize the WooCommerce checkout process, including or removing fields as required by your business flow.

### Force Shipping Address
Always display shipping fields by removing the toggle checkbox. Users are required to complete them.

### Force Account Creation
Force account creation during checkout. The account will be automatically created using the billing email provided by the user.

### Remove Order Notes
Option to remove the order notes field from the checkout form.

### Add Message Before Checkout
Display a custom message before or after the checkout form. Use this to engage or thank your customers.

== Premium Features ==

The premium version of Checkout Field Manager offers a wide range of advanced features for full control of the checkout fields:

- Filter fields based on cart subtotal
- Show/hide checkbox fields in the account, checkout, orders, emails, or invoices
- Add charges based on field values
- Display fields in the orders admin list and allow sorting/filtering
- WooCommerce cart and checkout on the same page
- Upload files in WooCommerce checkout

= How do I add conditional fields? =
[Adding conditional fields](https://quadlayers.com/documentation/woocommerce-checkout-manager/conditional/)

= Where can I see the custom field data in orders? =
Custom field data can be found within each order, inside the WooCommerce > Edit Order screen. Fields are grouped under Billing, Shipping, and Additional sections.

= Is it compatible with WooCommerce Checkout Blocks (Gutenberg)? =

At the moment, the plugin is **not compatible with the new WooCommerce Checkout Blocks introduced in version 8.3 and later**.

If you need support for the new block-based checkout, feel free to leave a comment or request in the support forum so we can prioritize this feature in future updates.

In the meantime, you can still use the plugin by ensuring your checkout page uses the classic shortcode (`[woocommerce_checkout]`). To do this, simply set the content of your checkout page to the shortcode to continue using all features of the plugin.
